                            is an infamous dogs vs cats classification problem which you would have definitely come acrossed,
                            if you are into deep learning. The deep learning model which i have used is convolutional neural
                            network since it performs well when dealing with image data. The data was available at
                            <i>https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data</i>. This resource consists
                            of 25,000 labeled images for training the model and 12,500 images for testing the model.

                            The goal here is to build a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California using the California Census Data.
                            The data has metrics such as population, median income, median housing prices, and so on. The
                            data was mostly raw and lacked any form of preprocessing. Hence a lot of time was invested in
                            processing and cleaning the data, thus getting it ready for a mathematical model to gain insights.
                            The data was tested with linear-regression, decision-tree-regressor and random-forest-regressor.

                        <h4>5) implementing batch normalization in tensorflow
                        </h4>
    
                        <div style="text-align: justify">
                            Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's 
                            inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down
                            the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it 
                            notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities.
                            Batch Normalization is used to address this kind of problems known as vanishing/exploding gradients
                            problems. The technique consists of adding operations such as zero centering, 
                            normalizing the inputs, scaling and shifting the results. These sequence of 
                            operations are added just before the activation function of each layer of our
                            deep neural network.<br><br>
                            According to the original paper by Sergey Ioffe, Google Inc and Christian Szegedy, Google Inc (arXiv:1502.03167 [cs.LG]), 
                            Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a 
                            significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet 
                            classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human 
                            raters.<br>
                            Here I will be showing you how you can implement the batch normalization on the MNIST dataset using tensorflow.
